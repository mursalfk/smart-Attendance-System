## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.1] - [2018-07-05)()
### Added
- Warn for more invalid headerStyle properties (padding, top/right/bottom/left, position).

### Fixed
- Fixed missing header shadow on Android.

## [2.6.0] - [2018-07-04](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.6.0)
### Added
- [NavigationEvents](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/pull/4188) component as a declarative interface for subscribing to navigation focus events.

### Fixed
- Fix stack router child router delegation priority (https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/e8c1833053e37d28f0ce505ff323565abf23b6a2)
- Avoid crash when calling isFocused on old route (https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/commit/0921889f7a3acfc6d6bcc4909d209eeeee985ba7)
- Stack router no longer attempts to parse query params within path handling
- Switch router now has exact same param treatment for URLs as stack router does

### Changed
- Internally we no longer need to special case PlatformHelpers by platform as react-native-web handles the APIs we mocked out with it now.

### Added
- Throw error in development mode when header navigation option is set to a string - a common mistake that would otherwise result in a cryptic error message.
- Throw error in development mode when title is not a string.

### Fixed
- Delegate to child routers for more than just the top screen in the stack.
- Update react-navigation-drawer to 0.4.3 to fix `initialRouteParams` option

## [2.5.4] - [2018-06-27](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.5.4)
### Fixed

## [2.5.3] - [2018-06-23](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.5.3)
### Fixed
- `setParams` applies to the navigation object it is called on even if that is the navigation object for a navigation view (more details in https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/issues/4497)

## [2.5.2] - [2018-06-23](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation/releases/tag/2.5.2)
